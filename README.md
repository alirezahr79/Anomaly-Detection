## üìù Project Description

Time series anomaly detection is a critical task in various domains, from finance to IoT, where identifying unexpected behavior in data is essential for decision-making and security. This project explores classic anomaly detection techniques tailored for time series data, including methods like:

- **Z-Score Analysis**: Detects anomalies based on statistical deviation.
- **Rolling Statistics**: Uses moving averages and standard deviations to flag anomalies.
- **Isolation Forest**: A tree-based model that isolates anomalies in high-dimensional data.
- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Identifies anomalies based on the local density of data points.
- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks trained to reconstruct input data, with anomalies detected as poorly reconstructed instances.

### Key Features:

- **Step-by-Step Implementation**: Each method is implemented from scratch, with explanations provided for the underlying concepts.
- **Interactive Exploration**: The Jupyter Notebook format allows for interactive experimentation, making it easy to adjust parameters and observe the effects on anomaly detection.
- **Visualizations**: Detailed plots and graphs are included to visualize the data and highlight detected anomalies.
